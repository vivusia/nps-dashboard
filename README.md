## 🧾 Project Overview

As part of a real business project, I developed an **interactive NPS (Net Promoter Score) dashboard in Power BI** that integrates both **quantitative metrics** and **qualitative customer feedback**.

Since the underlying data was spread across multiple Excel files, I built a **Python-based preprocessing pipeline** to:
- Automatically read and merge all Excel datasets  
- Clean and standardize free-text comments  
- Use **OpenAI’s GPT-4 model** to classify open responses into thematic categories  
  (e.g., *Cost*, *App performance*, *Journalistic quality*, etc.)  

The dataset consisted of **German-language customer feedback**, making this a multilingual NLP use case.  
GPT-4 successfully handled the zero-shot classification task without translation, demonstrating strong **multilingual generalization capabilities** even in non-English contexts.

This automated text classification enabled direct filtering of qualitative feedback by topic within the **Power BI dashboard**, linking it to quantitative KPIs such as NPS scores.  
As a result, the dashboard provides actionable insights into **customer satisfaction, recurring issues, and key improvement areas** — without the need for manual comment coding.

### 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The Power BI dashboard includes several key metrics to monitor customer sentiment and operational performance:

- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** – overall customer loyalty and satisfaction  
- **Response Rate** – share of users providing feedback  
- **Topic Frequency** – most mentioned categories from comment classification  
- **Sentiment Trends** – evolution of promoter, passive, and detractor shares  
- **Category-based NPS** – breakdown of NPS by main feedback themes  
- **Temporal Insights** – Time-based performance comparison  

These KPIs allow management to quickly identify areas for improvement and track the impact of implemented changes.

### 🧠 Why Zero-Shot Classification instead of Sentiment Analysis?

The project initially included a **sentiment analysis** step to identify whether user comments were positive, neutral, or negative.  
However, since the **NPS score (0–10)** already reflects the respondent’s satisfaction level, an additional sentiment layer would have been redundant.

Instead, the focus was shifted to a **zero-shot topic classification** approach using GPT-4.  
This method complements the NPS data by revealing **what users are talking about** rather than **how they feel** — uncovering the main drivers behind positive or negative feedback (e.g., price, app usability, journalistic quality, etc.).
